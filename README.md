2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Invite another player to play with you on the same device.
4. Click on the available cells to take turns placing your X or O symbol on the board.
5. The first player to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
6. If no player achieves a win after all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.
